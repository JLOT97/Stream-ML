## üßπ 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation Process <a name="cleaning"></a>

The first step in our project is data cleaning and preparation. In this step, we normalize and clean our dataset for further analysis and modeling. [See more](src/etl.ipynb)

## üìä 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) <a name="eda"></a>

Once the data is clean and prepared, we perform an EDA to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships in the data. [See more](src/eda.ipynb)

## üéØ 3. Recommendation Model <a name="model"></a>

We use the analysis of the data to build our recommendation system, which provides movie suggestions based on a movie title specified by the user. [See more](main.py)

## üí° 4. How to Use <a name="use"></a>

Users can interact with the API by visiting the server in their browser and providing a movie title. The API will return a list of recommended movies based on the provided title.

## üìñ 5. Usage Example <a name="example"></a>

To get movie recommendations, visit the server in your browser and provide a movie title. The API will return a list of recommended movies.

## üìö 6. API Endpoints <a name="endpoints"></a>

The *MovieMate* API offers various endpoints that provide unique functionalities for movie data exploration and recommendation generation. Here we describe each of them:

5. [`GetActorInformation`](https://stream-ml-jlot.onrender.com/docs): It allows you to retrieve information about a specific actor, such as the number of films they have participated in, the total return, and the average return of their movies. You just need to provide the actor's name. To use this endpoint, simply click on the endpoint name.

6. [`GetDirectorInformation`](https://stream-ml-jlot.onrender.com/docs): This endpoint provides information about a specific director, such as the total return of their movies and a list of their movies with details such as title, release year, return, budget, and revenue.
