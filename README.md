## üßπ 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation Process <a name="cleaning"></a>

The first step in our project is data cleaning and preparation. In this step, we normalize and clean our dataset for further analysis and modeling. [See more](src/etl.ipynb)

## üìä 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) <a name="eda"></a>

Once the data is clean and prepared, we perform an EDA to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships in the data. [See more](src/eda.ipynb)

## üéØ 3. Recommendation Model <a name="model"></a>

We use the analysis of the data to build our recommendation system, which provides movie suggestions based on a movie title specified by the user. [See more](main.py)

## üí° 4. How to Use <a name="use"></a>

Users can interact with the API by visiting the server in their browser and providing a movie title. The API will return a list of recommended movies based on the provided title.

## üìñ 5. Usage Example <a name="example"></a>

    2. `GetFilmingCountByDay`: Similar to the previous one, this endpoint returns the number of filmings made on a particular day of any month. You just need to provide the day in numeric format. To use this endpoint, visit: [here](https://stream-ml-jlot.onrender.com/cantidad_filmaciones_dia/{day})

    3. `GetFilmScoreByTitle`: Allows you to know the popularity score of a movie based on its title. You just need to provide the movie title. To use this endpoint, visit: [here](https://stream-ml-jlot.onrender.com/score_titulo/{title})

    5. `GetActorInformation`: Allows you to get information about a particular actor, such as the number of filmings they have participated in, the total return and the average return of their films. You just need to provide the actor's name. To use this endpoint, visit: [here](https://stream-ml-jlot.onrender.com/get_actor/{actor})

    6. `GetDirectorInformation`: This endpoint provides information about a particular director, such as the total return of their films and a list of their films with details such as the title, the release year, the return, the budget, and the revenue of each film.
