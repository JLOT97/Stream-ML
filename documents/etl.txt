** ETL Process Documentation **



Overview


The goal of this ETL process is to prepare a clean and well-structured dataset from two initial CSV files: movies_dataset.csv and credits.csv. 
The data is transformed and cleaned through various steps and the final result is a unified CSV file called movies_dataset_final.csv.



Step Description


1. Load and visualize data: The two CSV files are loaded into pandas dataframes and visualized for a first inspection.

2. Unnesting 'belongs_to_collection' column: This column, containing a dictionary in string format, is converted into a set of separate columns.

3. Handling null values: Null values in 'revenue' and 'budget' columns are filled with 0. Additionally, rows containing null values in the 'release_date' column are deleted.

4. Date formatting and release year extraction: The 'release_date' column is formatted and the release year is extracted to create a new column named 'release_year'.

5. Conversion of non-numeric values to NaN in 'budget' and calculation of return on investment: Non-numeric values in 'budget' are converted to NaN. Then, return 
   on investment is calculated, and a new column 'return' is created.

6. Unnesting and transformation of several columns: The 'genres', 'production_companies', 'production_countries', and 'spoken_languages' columns are transformed 
   to obtain lists of relevant elements.

7. Backup of the original dataframe: A backup of the original dataframe is made to prevent data loss.

8. Removal of unnecessary columns: Several columns that will not be used in the subsequent analysis are removed.

9. Removal of duplicates: Duplicate rows in the dataframe are removed.

10. Combination of dataframes: The resulting dataframes are combined into a unified dataframe.

11. Work with 'credits.csv' file: The 'credits.csv' file is loaded and duplicates are cleaned.

12. Extraction of relevant features from 'credits.csv': Relevant features are extracted and a new dataframe is created.

13. Combination of dataframes: The resulting dataframe is combined with the movie dataframe.

14. Saving the final dataframe: The final dataframe is saved as a new CSV file.



Additional Details


Each step of this ETL process is carefully documented in the code, with explanatory comments and visualizations where necessary. 
The process was designed with the aim of creating a clean, structured, and easy-to-analyze dataset for subsequent movie data analysis.
