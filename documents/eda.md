# Description of the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 



Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a fundamental stage in any data science project. It provides an initial understanding of the data
and reveals important patterns, trends, and relationships. In this section, an EDA is performed using various tools and techniques to 
explore a movie dataset.



*This file describes the process of conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset that contains information about movies.*


## 1. Library import: 
    
    The necessary libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization are imported.

## 2. Loading the data file: 

    The CSV file containing the information about the movies is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.

## 3. Setting display options: 
    
    Pandas is set up to display all columns of the DataFrame.

## 4. Inspecting the first records of the DataFrame: 

    The first records of the DataFrame are displayed to get an idea of the data we're working with.

## 5. Checking for missing values: 

    The number of missing values in each column of the DataFrame is checked.

## 6. Generating a histogram of the "vote_average" attribute: 

    A histogram is generated to visualize the distribution of the average votes of the movies.

## 7. Calculating the correlation matrix: 

    The correlation matrix between the numerical variables of the DataFrame is calculated and visualized using a heatmap.

## 8. Visualizing missing data: 

    Missing data is visualized using a matrix and a bar chart provided by the missingno library.

## 9. Generating a word cloud of the "genres" column: 

    A word cloud is generated based on the genres of the movies.

## 10. Visualizing the distribution of the 'revenue' and 'budget' attributes: 

    A histogram is generated to visualize the distribution of revenue and budget.

## 11. Summary statistics of 'revenue' and 'budget': 

    Summary statistics (such as mean, median, minimum, and maximum) are calculated for the 'revenue' and 'budget' attributes.

## 12. Relationship between 'revenue' and 'popularity': 

    A scatter plot is generated to visualize the relationship between revenue and popularity of the movies.

## 13. Relationship between 'runtime' and 'vote_average': 

    A scatter plot with a regression line and correlation coefficient is generated to analyze the relationship between the runtime of the movies and the average votes they receive.



The objective of this process is to explore and gain an in-depth understanding of the data, identify key patterns, trends, and relationships, and obtain valuable insights for decision-making and further model development. EDA is an essential stage in the lifecycle of a data science project, as it lays the foundation for subsequent data processing, feature selection, model creation, and result validation. Effective EDA provides valuable information for domain understanding, identifies data issues, and generates hypotheses.
