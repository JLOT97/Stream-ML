** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Documentation **




Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a fundamental stage in any data science project. It provides an initial understanding of the data and reveals important patterns, 
trends, and relationships. In this section, an EDA is performed using various tools and techniques to explore a movie dataset.



Step 1: Import the necessary libraries

    Used Libraries
    pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
    missingno: Used for visualizing missing data.
    matplotlib.pyplot: Used for data visualization.
    wordcloud: Used for generating word clouds.
    sweetviz: Used for automatic EDA report generation.
    seaborn: Used for advanced data visualization.
    Step 1: Import Libraries
    The necessary libraries for data analysis are imported.


Step 2: Load the Data File

    The CSV file is loaded into a pandas DataFrame using the read_csv function.


Step 3: Set Visualization Options

    The visualization options are set to display all columns in the DataFrame using the set_option function.


Step 4: Display the First Few Rows of the DataFrame

    The first few rows of the DataFrame are displayed using the head method.


Step 5: Display the First Few Rows of the DataFrame (Repeated)

    The first few rows of the DataFrame are displayed again using the head method.


Step 6: Check for Missing Values

    The number of missing values in each column of the DataFrame is printed using the isnull().sum() method.


Step 7: Generate a Histogram of the "vote_average" Attribute

    A histogram of the "vote_average" attribute is plotted using the hist method.


Step 8: Calculate the Correlation Matrix and Display it as a Heatmap

    The relevant columns are selected to calculate the correlation matrix. The matrix is calculated using the corr method, and it is displayed as a heatmap using 
    the heatmap function from seaborn.


Step 9: Visualize Missing Data Using a Matrix and a Bar Chart

    The missing data is visualized using a matrix and a bar chart using the matrix and bar functions from missingno.


Step 10: Generate a Word Cloud of the "genres" Column

    The non-null values in the "genres" column are filtered, and all the values are concatenated into a single string. A word cloud based on the concatenated 
    values is generated using the WordCloud class from wordcloud.


Step 11: Visualize the Distribution of Revenue and Budget

    A histogram of additional numeric variables "revenue" and "budget" is plotted to visualize their distribution using the plot method.


Step 12: Calculate Summary Statistics for Revenue and Budget

    Summary statistics for additional numeric variables "revenue" and "budget" are calculated using the describe method, and they are printed using the print function.


Step 13: Relationship between Revenue and Popularity

    A scatter plot of the "revenue" and "popularity" attributes is created to examine their relationship using the scatter function from matplotlib.pyplot.


Step 14: Relationship between Runtime and Vote Average

    A scatter plot with a regression line and correlation coefficient is created to analyze the relationship between the "runtime" attribute and the vote average
    using the regplot function from seaborn.




The objective of this process is to explore and gain an in-depth understanding of the data, identify key patterns, trends, and relationships, and obtain valuable 
insights for decision-making and further model development. EDA is an essential stage in the lifecycle of a data science project, as it lays the foundation for 
subsequent data processing, feature selection, model creation, and result validation. Effective EDA provides valuable information for domain understanding, identifies
data issues, and generates hypotheses.
