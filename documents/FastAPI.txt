** FastAPI Movie Analysis Application Documentation **



1. Overview of FastAPI

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. 
A key feature of FastAPI is its automatic and interactive API documentation. This application uses these features to provide analytical data about movies
through several FastAPI endpoints.
